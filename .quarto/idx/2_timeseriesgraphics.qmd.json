You should build up an intuition of what a stationary time series is, and what autocorrelation is. White noise is a simplest time series process you can think of and the building block of ARIMA models. Here we try to give a short introduction to these concepts. Some of these have already been introduced in MET4 at NHH. So if you have taken that course, this may serve as a short repetition.\n\n## What is time series data\n\nBelow is a video from Aric LaBarr's youtube series explaing time series concepts in less than 5 minutes. In the video below he explains what time series data is - as opposed to cross sectional data. As he points out, we also some times have a combination which we can e.g. aggregate to cross sectional data or time series data. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsroWpkUuYI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Time series notation\n\nIt is quite common in statistics in general, but also in time series analysis, to distinguish between capital and non-capital letters. While $Y_t$ denotes the stochastic variable $Y$ at time $t$, $y_t$ is the realization of said stochastic variable $Y_t$, i.e. an observed value. $Y_t$ is a specific variable, while $\\{Y_t\\}$ is the entire time series. While a stochastic variable has for instance an expectation, a variance, a dependence structure and a distribution, an observation is just a number. \n\nLet $\\mu_t=\\mu_Y(t)=\\mathrm{E}(Y_t)$ denote the mean function of $Y_t$. Assuming that $E(Y_t^2)<\\infty$, the covariance function of $\\{Y_t\\}$ is denoted \n$$\\gamma(r,s)=\\gamma_Y(r,s)= \\mathrm{Cov}(Y_r,Y_s)=\\mathrm{E}(Y_r-\\mu_r)(Y_s-\\mu_s).$$ \nIf the covariance function does not depend on the specific values of $r$ and $s$, but rather the distance between them $h = |r-s|$, we write $\\gamma(r,s)=\\gamma(h)$. Likewise, if $\\mu_t$ does not depend on $t$, we write $\\mu_t=\\mu$. This will be used in the section about stationarity below. Note that the variance of $Y_t$ is given by $\\gamma(t,t) = \\mathrm{Cov}(Y_t,Y_t) = \\mathrm{Var}(Y_t)$ or $\\gamma(0)$ in the case where the covariance does not depend on $t$.\n\n\n\n## tsibble\n\nThe tsibble object will be important in this course. Since we are working in the tidyverse, things will be easier if we commit to it. Converting your data to a time series tibble (tsibble) is essential. The tsibble extends the tidy tibble data frame by introducing temporal structure. Read the chapter 2.1 about [tsibble objects in the textbook](https://otexts.com/fpp3/tsibbles.html). Here you find several coding examples. \n\n## Stationarity\n\nWe return to Labarr's time series in 5 minutes series on youtube explaining stationarity. This is a key concept in time series. The video by Labarr gives a nice intuition for the concept. It separates between strong and weak stationarity. In this course, the weak stationarity condition will be the one we focus on, but it is nice to know that there are other definitions of stationarity as well. For a time series to be (weakly) stationary the mean and variance of the time series variable $Y_t$ should not depend on $t$. More formally, a time series is weakly stationary if \n\n1) The expectation is constant: $\\mu_t = \\mu$\n2) The variance is constant and finite: $\\sigma_t^2 = \\sigma^2 < \\infty$\n3) The covariance between two lagged variables only depend on the lag: $\\gamma(r,s) = \\gamma(h)$, where $h=|r-s|$. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aIdTGKjQWjA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIn the video, Labarr shows some examples of non-stationary time series which can be transformed to stationary time series by differencing. We will come back to this later in the course, when we talk about transformations and again when we study ARIMA models. We will also study examples of stationary time / non-stationary time series in the voluntary homework. You can also read about the stationarity in the [textbook](https://otexts.com/fpp3/stationarity.html), but for now, you may stop after the paragraph on stationarity. The book is less specific about their definition, but we will stick the weakly stationary definition above. \n\n\n<!-- ## Autocorrelation -->\n<!-- We will cover this in c -->\n\n\n\n## White noise\nA white noise series is a time series of uncorrelated observations with mean zero and finite variance. We will often write it as $Z_t$ where $Z_t \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0,\\sigma^2)$. The standard is that the series is uncorrelated, but we may require it to be independent (stronger assumption) and very often normally distributed. In that case we call it iid Gaussian white noise (iid = independent and identically distributed). Notation for this may be $Z_t \\sim \\text{iid}\\,  \\mathrm{WN}(0,\\sigma^2)$. Let us generate a white noise series in R.\n\n```{r} \nlibrary(fpp3)\nset.seed(123) # To produce the same output\nwn <- tsibble(\n  t = 1:100,\n  Z = rnorm(100, sd = 3), # Draws from N(0, 3^2) distribution\n  index = \"t\"\n) \nwn %>% \n  autoplot() + \n  labs(title = \"Gaussian White noise\",\n       subtitle = \"iid WN(0,9)\")\n```\n\nWe can then plot the acf of the series:\n```{r}\nwn %>%\n  ACF(Z) %>%\n  autoplot() + \n  labs(title=\"White noise ACF\")\n```\nAs you can see, all the correlations fall within the confidence bands. The series is uncorrelated. You can also find a similar example in the [textbook](https://otexts.com/fpp3/wn.html).\n\n<!-- ## Exercises -->\n\n<!-- 1.
