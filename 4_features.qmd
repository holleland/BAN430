# Features

Here we will go through how to calculate features in R and show some examples of features you can calculate for time series using the feasts package. You find more details in [Chapter 4.1-4.3 of Hyndman and Athanasopoulos(2021)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/some-simple-statistics.html). The code used in this lecture is an adaptation of what you find in these sections.
