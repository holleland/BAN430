# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the website for BAN430 Forecasting. We will use this website as a supplement to lectures. The website is an ongoing development, so not all subjects will have content yet. Below you will find a detailed (preliminary) lecture plan, link to the textbook and curriculum.

## Lecture plan

```{r lecturePlan, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
readxl::read_excel("lecturePlan.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet3",
                           col_types= rep("text",3))[,-1] %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover"),
                fixed_thead = T) %>%
    row_spec(seq(1,25,2) , background = "#2E8B5750") %>% 
    row_spec(28, bold = T, background = "DarkRed", color = "white")

```
