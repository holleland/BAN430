# R and Rstudio

In this course, we will be using R and Rstudio to e.g. visualize time series, estimate model parameters, forecast, etc. It is therefore essential to have some basic knowledge of how to write an R script and how to read in data and do some simple data manipulation for preparing the data for different time series analysis. Hopefully, most of you have some experience with R and Rstudio before. If you have, this will be a short recap, if not this will be a very short introduction covering the most basic operations.
